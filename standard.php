                    <h2>Deep Cleaning</h2>
                    <h3>Top to Bottom Move in/out Deep Cleaning Package</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Our Top to Bottom Deep Cleaning Package represents the most thorough cleaning service provided by our
                    company. Every reachable surface within your home will either be scrubbed or wiped by our
                    professional housekeepers. The biggest difference between this cleaning and all other packages lies
                    in the amount of detail required to clean your vertical surfaces, such as baseboards, trim work,
                    interior windows, interior & exterior cabinets/drawers, light fixtures and even doors. All
                    horizontal surfaces will also be cleaned; including floors, tabletops, counters and inside and
                    outside of all appliances. Dusting is another big difference maker in this type of cleaning by
                    removing all items and dusting underneath the items located on horizontal surfaces. So pick up your
                    feet, sit back and relax while we clean everything inside your home from top to bottom. This
                    cleaning is the closest thing to magic because our desire is to create a magical experience that
                    creates a perfectly clean home without you lifting a finger.</p>
                <h3>Home Cleaning Standard Or Deep Clean In LA</h3>
                <p>The deep clean service option is a comprehensive top-to-bottom cleaning of your home. We recommend a
                    deep cleaning if you have not had your apartment professionally cleaned within the past 2-6 months,
                    or if you do not use a cleaning service on a regular basis. A deep clean includes all the services
                    of a standard clean, but with more attention to areas you may have forgotten to clean over time.
                    This in-depth cleaning will get your home ‘super’ clean. Our deep cleaning maids and housekeepers
                    know exactly where to focus their efforts; whether it is under your bed or that corner that you
                    haven’t attempted to clean in months. We prepare your home for easier cleanings in the future. Trust
                    us, you won’t be disappointed!</p>
                <p>When you do not use a cleaning service on a regular basis, certain areas tend to be neglected, either
                    because you simply forget or are in a rush to complete your own cleaning. <b><u>Our Deep Clean is
                            recommended for the first visit. Afterwards, our Standard Clean will be more than enough to
                            keep your house in top shape.</u></b></p>
                <p>So what does it include? It is our Standard RG`s Cleaning but with more attention to detail and more
                    time dedicated to your home.</p>
                <p>This is perfect for making your home clean, sanitized and sparkling like brand new, just the way you
                    want it. We also bring all cleaning supplies.</p>
                <p>The Deep Clean does not include the inside of kitchen appliances such as refrigerator, oven inside
                    kitchen cabinets, inside of windows, etc. These need to be booked as extra’s.</p>
                <p>We also tailor cleanings to what you want to get cleaned! Just let us know in the form which areas
                    you’d like our cleaners to focus on, and we’ll handle the rest.</p>

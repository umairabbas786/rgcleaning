                </div>
                <p>The last thing you want to think about when you’re moving is cleaning. But if you want your security
                    deposit you’re going to have to exert some elbow grease. Why not save your time and energy, and get
                    a professional to clean for you.</p>
                <p>Don’t loose your security deposit! Your <u>Security Deposit</u> is normally equivalent to a full
                    month’s rent so it’s worth cleaning for. It will no doubt come in handy when moving.</p>

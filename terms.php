                        <h5>RG`s Cleaning Prices</h5>
                        <p style="color: black;">RG`s cleaning prices are based on square feet and the type of service required that you have requested. Additional charges above the initial estimate may occur if you request additional services at the time of your appointment. All additional charges must be authorized by both the client and the office.</p>
                        <h5>RG`s Cleaning Staff</h5>
                        <p style="color: black;">Our standard team size is 2 employees; however, we also regularly will send just 1, or a team of 3 to 4. The price does not change depending on how many employees we send. Please contact the office if you have a requirement on team size, and we will do our best to accommodate it.</p>

                        <p style="color: black;">We require 48hrs notice if you need to cancel/reschedule your appointment. To avoid being charged a late cancellation fee, please cancel or reschedule your appointment in time. The cancellation fee is equal to the full price of your cleaning. Please note that the late cancellation policy also applies if the cleaning crew is unable to gain access to the jobsite at the designated appointment time and needs to be rescheduled/canceled (ie. locked out of the house).</p>
                        <h5>Communication</h5>
                        <p style="color: black;">To ensure the best possible service, please do not leave notes or give special instructions or service changes to our crews. All information regarding your cleaning service must be communicated directly to the office so that the information is not lost or misunderstood.</p>
